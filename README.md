# nanorlhf
This project aims to perform RLHF training from scratch, implementing almost all core components manually except for PyTorch. Each module is a minimal, educational reimplementation of large-scale systems focusing on clarity and core concepts rather than production readiness. This includes SFT and RL training pipeline with evaluation, for training a small Qwen3 model on open-source math datasets.
