    Manages random seeds for different parallel modes in a distributed training setup.

    Discussion:
        Q. Why manage seeds per parallel mode?
            In distributed training, different parallel modes (e.g., data parallelism, model parallelism)
            may require different random seeds to ensure reproducibility and proper randomness.
            This manager allows for easy switching between modes while preserving their RNG states.
